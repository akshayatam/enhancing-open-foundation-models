# Enhancing Open Foundation Models with NLP Techniques and Digital Signatures

This repository contains my graduate-level (CS 800 – Advanced Topics in Computer Science) research paper exploring methods to improve the robustness, accountability, and ethical deployment of open foundation models.

## Overview

Open foundation models such as GPT-3 and Llama 2 have democratized access to large-scale AI systems. However, their openness introduces challenges including:

- Susceptibility to misuse and disinformation
- Limited interpretability
- Bias and fairness concerns
- Traceability and governance gaps

This paper reviews existing NLP methodologies that address these issues and proposes a novel **Model Signature framework** to enhance traceability and accountability of AI-generated content.

## Key Areas Covered

- Explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME)
- Automated fact-checking pipelines
- Ethics-aware fine-tuning strategies
- Invisible watermarking for text
- Cryptographic hash-based model traceability

## Proposed Contribution

The paper introduces a policy-driven “Model Signature” concept built on four principles:

- **Security**
- **Uniqueness**
- **Invisibility**
- **Traceability**

This framework aims to strengthen governance mechanisms for open foundation models while preserving innovation.
